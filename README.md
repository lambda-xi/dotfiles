Lambda's Dotfiles

This repo holds all of the important configurations that I use in my development environment either for aesthetics or production. Feel free to use it as a point of reference for your own config.

### .zshrc
- I use powerlevel9k and ProFont patched with [Nerd Fonts](http://www.nerdfonts.com)
- I try to set my zsh theme to be different when on a TTY
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is my zsh framework.

### vscode (.config/Code/settings.json)
- I use Fira Code and love ligatures, to enable these ligatures, set `editor.fontLigatures` to true.
